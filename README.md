Keyring provides a common interface to a range of secure credential storage services. Originally developed as part of [AWS Vault](https://github.com/byteness/aws-vault), a command line tool for securely managing AWS access from developer workstations.

Currently Keyring supports the following backends
 * [macOS Keychain](https://support.apple.com/en-au/guide/keychain-access/welcome/mac) (with TouchID support 🎉)
 * [Windows Credential Manager](https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/4026814/windows-accessing-credential-manager)
 * [Windows Hello](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/configure-windows-hello-dae28983-8242-bb2a-d3d1-87c9d265a5f0)-gated encrypted Credential Manager backend
 * Secret Service ([Gnome Keyring](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GnomeKeyring), [KWallet](https://kde.org/applications/system/org.kde.kwalletmanager5))
 * [KWallet](https://kde.org/applications/system/org.kde.kwalletmanager5)
 * [Pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/)
 * [Passage](https://github.com/FiloSottile/passage)
 * [Encrypted file (JWT)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519)
 * [KeyCtl](https://linux.die.net/man/1/keyctl)
 * [1Password Connect](https://developer.1password.com/docs/connect/)
 * [1Password Service Accounts](https://developer.1password.com/docs/service-accounts)
 * [1Password Desktop Application Integration](https://developer.1password.com/docs/sdks/desktop-app-integrations/)

## Usage

The short version of how to use keyring is shown below.

```go
ring, _ := keyring.Open(keyring.Config{
  ServiceName: "example",
})

_ = ring.Set(keyring.Item{
	Key: "foo",
	Data: []byte("secret-bar"),
})

i, _ := ring.Get("foo")

fmt.Printf("%s", i.Data)
```

To configure TouchId biometrics:

```go
keyring.Config.UseBiometrics = true
keyring.Config.TouchIDAccount = "cc.byteness.aws-vault.biometrics"
keyring.Config.TouchIDService = "aws-vault"
```

### Windows Hello backend

The `winhello` backend stores encrypted envelopes in Windows Credential Manager.
This may sound similar to the `wincred` backend, but the difference is encryption.
Here, we don't store plaintext item data in Credential Manager. It is encrypted
with AES-256-GCM, and the content encryption key is wrapped by a Windows Hello /
Passport KSP key and unwrapped through an interactive private-key operation.

Upon the first use, a new Passport KSP key is created and stored in the user's
protected key store. This operation requires user interaction and Windows Hello
authentication. Later, whenever an item is accessed, the content encryption key
is unwrapped by the Passport KSP key, which requires Windows Hello authentication
again. This means that every access to the stored secrets requires user presence
and authentication through Windows Hello (using PIN, fingerprint, face ID, etc.).

This protects against silent reads of the stored Credential Manager blob. It
does not protect against malware that can read process memory after a successful
unlock, inject into an approved process, or steal credentials after they are
handed to a caller.

To use the Windows Hello backend on Windows:

```go
ring, err := keyring.Open(keyring.Config{
  ServiceName: "example",
  AllowedBackends: []keyring.BackendType{
    keyring.WinHelloBackend,
  },
})
if err != nil {
  return err
}
```

For more detail on the API please check [the keyring godocs](https://godoc.org/github.com/byteness/keyring)

### Proton Pass backend

> **Experimental.** The `proton-pass` backend targets Proton's Pass API, which is
> unofficial and undocumented: it can change without notice and break this backend.
> Treat it as beta, pin your dependency, and re-test after upgrades. It is gated behind
> the `keyring_noprotonpass` build tag (see below) and excluded from opt-out builds.

The `proton-pass` backend stores each secret as an item in a Proton Pass vault,
authenticated with a Proton Personal Access Token (PAT) of the form `pst_<token>::<key>`,
so no browser and no `pass-cli` subprocess are involved. Item content is decrypted
client-side (AES-256-GCM down Proton's key hierarchy). Because the API is reverse
engineered, the client sends app/SDK version headers mirroring the Proton Pass CLI (for
example `cli-pass@2.1.4`); Proton may change what it accepts, so those pins can need
updating over time.

```go
ring, err := keyring.Open(keyring.Config{
  ServiceName: "example",
  AllowedBackends: []keyring.BackendType{
    keyring.ProtonPassBackend,
  },
  ProtonPassShareID: "<share-id>",
})
if err != nil {
  return err
}
```

The PAT is read from the `PROTON_PASS_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable (or a
configured token function), never a command-line flag.

### Reducing the dependency surface (opt-out build tags)

The cross-platform backends compile into every build, whether or not you use
them, along with their dependency trees. If you know at build time that you
don't need a backend, an opt-out build tag excludes it (and its dependencies)
from compilation:

| Build tag | Backends removed | Headline dependencies dropped |
|---|---|---|
| `keyring_no1password` | `op`, `op-connect`, `op-desktop` | `onepassword-sdk-go` (incl. the `wazero` WebAssembly runtime), `connect-sdk-go` (incl. `jaeger-client-go`) |
| `keyring_nofile` | `file` | `dvsekhvalnov/jose2go` |
| `keyring_nopass` | `pass` | none (shells out to `pass`) |
| `keyring_nopassage` | `passage` | none (shells out to `passage`) |

```bash
go build -tags keyring_no1password ./...
```

The platform-specific backends (`keychain`, `wincred`, `winhello`,
`secret-service`, `kwallet`, `keyctl`) are already gated by GOOS constraints
and need no tags. Default builds (no tags) are unaffected. An excluded backend
is simply absent from `AvailableBackends()`, and requesting it explicitly
returns `ErrNoAvailImpl` — the same behavior as a backend that's unavailable
on the current platform. The `BackendType` constants and `Config` fields are
always present, so there is no API change under any tag.


## Testing

[Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) is used to create linux and windows test environments.

```bash
# Start vagrant
vagrant up

# Run go tests on all platforms
./bin/go-test
```
